# Milk After Ivor

|             |
| :-----------|
| An early start, |
| For Corrageen, |
| In the heart, |
| Of Ireland, |
| A perfect place, |
| To catch up, |
| With family, |
| And dear friends. |
| &nbsp; |
| At the airport, |
| Meet in the bar, |
| Just eggs for me, |
| But beer, for some; |
| Holiday's begun! |
| Then hurrying! |
| Board the flight! |
| To Celtic delight. |
| &nbsp; |
| Arrive midday, |
| Two on the bus, |
| Everyone else, |
| In the car, |
| Windy and wet, |
| Off we set, |
| Via a Lidl stop, |
| First of many. |
| &nbsp; |
| Arrive at last, |
| Eleven fed, |
| And watered. |
| Then we venture, |
| 'cross the stream, |
| And the bog, |
| Through the ferns, |
| Up to White Rock. |
| &nbsp; |
| Off to bed, |
| And a shed, |
| And a cupboard, |
| Whatever works, |
| It doesn't matter, |
| Constant chatter, |
| Enjoy being, |
| All together. |
| &nbsp; |
| To Blackwater, |
| Curious seal, |
| Head above waves, |
| Peeking a steal, |
| At the humans, |
| Beachcombing, |
| For sea shells, |
| On the seashore. |
| &nbsp; |
| Edenvale woods, |
| Trees straddle brook, |
| Waterfalls, |
| Old mill walls, |
| Wild mushrooms, |
| Pooh stick race, |
| Teddy on the gate, |
| A message of hope. |
| &nbsp; |
| In the garden, |
| Stood stock-still, |
| Hoping to see, |
| Hen Harrier, |
| Against the hills, |
| Which were mountains, |
| To small legs, |
| That aren't small now. |
| &nbsp; |
| Now a dozen, |
| Juggling balls, |
| Moonlight Sonata, |
| Classical Guitar, |
| Czech songs, |
| Wonderwall, |
| Hallelujah, |
| Lots of laughter. |
| &nbsp; |
| Then fourteen, |
| An afternoon, |
| At the house, |
| Eating, drinking, |
| Kin keeping, |
| Try headstands, |
| And handstands. |
| New yew pendants. |
| &nbsp; |
| Evening walk, |
| Down Cowpat Lane, |
| But the cows came, |
| Townies tamed, |
| Then Mischa herds, |
| Courage inspired, |
| Down we race, |
| To the fairy place. |
| &nbsp; |
| In the morning, |
| Up the (mountain), |
| Blueberry picking, |
| I stop counting, |
| The ravens soar, |
| Over those ahead, |
| Sail the wind, |
| On rocky crag. |
| &nbsp; |
| Kris can't come, |
| Fat pad contusion, |
| Good punk band name, |
| Fat Pad Concussion, |
| "I'm gonna do, |
| What I ***king want!, |
| Dance, sing, act, |
| Like I forgot!". |
| &nbsp; |
| In the evening, |
| Pretty Duncannon, |
| Windswept and wild, |
| Eyes full of sand, |
| Kitesurfers jumping. |
| Then Dunbrody Abbey, |
| Shots of Kris and me, |
| Looking happy. |
| &nbsp; |
| Hook Head Lighthouse, |
| Don't shine for us, |
| Road closed, |
| For an Irish hour. |
| We opt instead, |
| For Baginbun Bay, |
| Beautifully fresh, |
| On a rainy day. |
| &nbsp; |
| On the way home, |
| Stop off in town, |
| At the bloody Lidl, |
| For milk after Ivor, |
| Shows us 'round, |
| His building site, |
| That one day might, |
| Become his home. |
| &nbsp; |
| Two new faces, |
| To new places; |
| St Mullin's Mill, |
| Artists arting, |
| Dozens around, |
| Retreat my ground, |
| A Guinness found, |
| In the local pub. |
| &nbsp; |
| A brief break, |
| In the weather, |
| A slim chance, |
| For a fire, |
| So we danced, |
| And we blew, |
| And she rose, |
| Toast Marshmallows. |
| &nbsp; |
| Another Lidl run, |
| For birthday, |
| Provisions. |
| Then up the hill, |
| While Pavlova, |
| (or a meringue), |
| Was baked, |
| In their honour. |
| &nbsp; |
| In the morning, |
| UK beckoning, |
| Lots of crying, |
| At people leaving, |
| But it's not the end, |
| It's just goodbye, |
| Until we meet again, |
| In Corrageen. |
