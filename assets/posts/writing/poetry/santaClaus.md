# Santa Claus?

|             |
| :-----------|
| According to the long-held Christmas myth, |
| Santa Claus is a Mister not a Miss. |
| But #metoo made me wonder, |
| If it would be wrong to change gender? |
| And whether we would come to regret, |
| Renaming the jolly Santa, Clausette? |
| &nbsp; |
| But I began to consider gender-free, |
| The same as Doctor Who's thought to be, |
| An alien not sexed by any hue, |
| Not L, G, B, T or even Q. |
| An extra-terrestrial in the chimney. |
| Neither Claus, or Clausette, but Claus E.T. |
