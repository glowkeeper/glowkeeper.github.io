| My partner likes small, hard things, |
| Which is likely a very good job, |

| It explains why she's into my... |

| Knobs are useful on doors. |
| And doors are useful in holes. |
| Mats are useful on floors. |
| But eyes aren't useful for moles. |
| &nbsp; |
| Moles and my partner - seldom linked. |
| Except in the occasional poem; |
| Typically, their worlds are distinct, |
| One above - the other below them. |
| &nbsp; |
| Moles also like small, hard things, |
| Which they often put in their gob, |
| But unlike my lovely partner, |

| &nbsp; |
| Knobs are also useful on amps, |
| So the volume can slowly build up, |
| To eleven; so next door shouts, |
| "For **** sake! Shut the **** up!" |
| &nbsp; |
| My partner, moles, and small hard things, |
| Worth celebrating once in a while, |
| Easily pulls on my heartstrings, |
| When small hard things make my partner smile. |
