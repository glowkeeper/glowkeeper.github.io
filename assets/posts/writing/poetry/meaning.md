# Meaning

| My missus works at an inner-city school, |
| Where fascinating language is often the rule. |
| The students who don't never do no latin, |
| Or any logic class have they sat in, |
| Will moan about their peers rather loudly: |
| "She don't never do nothing for nobody", |
| Which don't never not parse in plain English, |
| And my logical mind glitch/glitch/glitches. |
| But if I pause my thinking head for a while, |
| Tell my English-parsing brain, "don't compile!", |
| It's obvious they meant to convey, |
| That the girl wouldn't help them today! |
| So who cares if it don't do no screening? |
| When I entirely understand its meaning. |
