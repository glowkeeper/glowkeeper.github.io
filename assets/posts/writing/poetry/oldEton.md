# Old Eton

|             |
| :-----------|
| For far too long, |
| From Old Eton, |
| The class system, |
| Has banged the drum. |
| &nbsp; |
| For far too long, |
| From Old Eton, |
| Life's cruel songs, |
| Dance servile throngs. |
| &nbsp; |
| For Far Too Long, |
| Has Old Eton, |
| Been champion, |
| Without question. |
| &nbsp; |
| For Far Too Long, |
| Has Old Eton, |
| Sneered down upon, |
| Folk of Britain. |
| &nbsp; |
| "Modern" Britain, |
| It saddens me, |
| Cancelled, cruel, |
| Sans any empathy. |
| &nbsp; |
| The time has come, |
| For New Britain, |
| To bang the drum, |
| Of new systems. |
| &nbsp; |
| The time has come, |
| For New Britain, |
| Uplifting songs, |
| Dance all persons. |
| &nbsp; |
| The time has come, |
| For New Britain, |
| New bastions, |
| Earned champions. |
| &nbsp; |
| The time has come, |
| Forge New Britain, |
| Empathy tons, |
| United throngs. |
| &nbsp; |
| Modern Britain, |
| I wish to see, |
| Woke, kind and full, |
| Of loving empathy. |
