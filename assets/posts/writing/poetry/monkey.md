# I Wish You Were A Monkey

|             |
| :-----------|
| I wish you were a monkey, |
| That I could scratch behind the ears, |
| I would feed you lots of 'nanas, |
| And hug away your years. |
| &nbsp; |
| I'd pretend to be a lion, |
| As we wrestled on the ground, |
| Strong, fearless, gentle, proud and wise |
| My hero I have found. |
| &nbsp; |
| Then I'd cling to you tightly, |
| As you climbed into the trees, |
| I'd fall asleep amidst your calm, |
| Delight, the midnight breeze. |
| &nbsp; |
| But now I'm home, alone again, |
| A monkey? Not really my wish! |
| Just a present father's love, |
| A dad to spend time with. |
| &nbsp; |
| Instead, you're at your office, |
| Or in a soulless airport lounge, |
| Away from home yet again, |
| Your time I have to scrounge. |
| &nbsp; |
| I don't think it's much to ask, |
| To want you home sometimes for tea, |
| After we'd play-fight, and run, |
| And then you'd read to me. |
| &nbsp; |
| Then I'd cling to you tightly, |
| You climb in beside me, please! |
| I'd fall asleep amidst your calm, |
| Delight, your mighty squeeze. |
