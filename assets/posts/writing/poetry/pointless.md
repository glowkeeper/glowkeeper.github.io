# Pointless

|             |
| :-----------|
| Hopefully, this will be pointless, |
| The walk to the next (sheltered) stop, |
| What else is hopefully pointless? |
| I pondered in my sodden strop. |
| &nbsp; |
| Hopefully, this will be pointless, |
| Like a coat on a summer's day, |
| Hopefully, this will be pointless, |
| Like the ref's whistle during play. |
| &nbsp; |
| Hopefully, this will be pointless, |
| Like a football team's back four, |
| Hopefully, this will be pointless, |
| Like wanting to go back for more. |
| &nbsp; |
| Hopefully, this will be pointless, |
| Like the neighbour's back door key, |
| Hopefully, this will be pointless, |
| Like "I love you" before I leave. |
| &nbsp; |
| Hopefully, this will be pointless, |
| Like third-party insurance, |
| Hopefully, this will be pointless, |
| Like my goodwill's endurance. |
| &nbsp; |
| Hopefully, this will be pointless, |
| Like the spare wheel in a car, |
| Hopefully, this will be pointless, |
| Like a flare to help me ashore. |
| &nbsp; |
| Hopefully, this will be pointless, |
| Like some security guys in a pub, |
| Hopefully, this will be pointless, |
| Like salt and pepper on my grub. |
| &nbsp; |
| Thankfully, it all became pointless, |
| Just like my pondering had hoped. |
| As I retraced steps (oh-so pointless), |
| 'Cause I spotted the bus up the road, |
| &nbsp; |
| And however hopefully pointless, |
| The things on this list may appear, |
| They're never actually pointless, |
| 'Cause they comfort by just being there. |
