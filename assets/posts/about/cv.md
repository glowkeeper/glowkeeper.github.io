# Dr Steve Huckle

I am an accomplished developer, educated to doctoral level, who enjoys teaching.

## Professional Profile

I am a Lecturer in Computer Graphics and Computer Science at the University of Sussex, where I teach students on the university's games degree [Programming for 3D](https://github.com/glowkeeper/P3D), a module that uses Unity to train the students on the fundamentals of a 3D space and games programming.

My career in computing began in the early 1990s. After earning a distinction for my bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I worked as a UNIX Systems Administrator. I then ran my own web-based business, streaming DJ mixes online. That sparked an interest in digital music, so 2003 I undertook a master's degree in Music Technology. That led to my becoming an Audio Programmer in games, where I worked on various released titles.

In 2013, a friend asked me to build him a Bitcoin mining rig, and so began my journey into teaching. I have since completed a [PhD](/academia/phd) that focused on blockchains, where my [thesis](/assets/docs/pHDThesis.pdf) asked whether the technology could help overcome some of the most urgent problems facing humanity. In short, they might help, but it is impossible to solve all of humanity's issues through technology; we must also change political, economic, and cultural goals.

## Experience

- I currently teach university students 3D games programming
- Five years of programming within the games industry, where I worked on four completed titles
- I have nearly thirty years of experience in the computing industry, beginning in 1992 with a City & Guilds COBOL programming course
- I have been writing full-stack Javascript since 2016 – React frontends. Node.js, Express backends
- I have a decade of experience with blockchains, including four years researching the technology as part of a [PhD](/academia/phd)
- Many years of freelance computing experience, during which I created and maintained many websites
- Early in my professional career, I was a UNIX Systems Administrator. I maintain strong Linux and Mac command-line skills
