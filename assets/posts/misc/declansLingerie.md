# Declan's Lingerie

Deep in the East End, nestled in a regenerated part of Old London Town, a peculiar structure sends shivers down the spine of those who dare to venture near it. It is a stadium that is said to be haunted by the spirit of Declan Rice, a former inhabitant who met a gruesome end under mysterious circumstancesâ€”he somehow ended up playing for Arsenal. Rumours swirled around the city about strange occurrences within the stadium's walls. Disembodied shadows that move on their own. Whispers that seem to come from nowhere. Eerie presences linger in the air. Many believe it is the restless spirit of Declan Rice, seeking revenge for the injustices done to him in life.

One fateful night, a group of unsuspecting Brighton and Hove Albion supporters ventured onto the Woolwich ferry (they got lost and missed the turning for the Blackwall Tunnel), determined to test their courage and explore the eerie stadium on one of its off-season tours. As they crept through the dark, dusty corridors, a cold chill ran down their spines, and they could feel the weight of a spirit's gaze upon them. Suddenly, they stumbled upon a room unlike any other they had ever seen; at the centre was a trophy cabinet, replete with the European Cup Winners Cup, FA Cup, Intertoto Cup, a Conference League trophy and a replica of the old Jules Rimet World Cup that West Ham won in 1966. Declan Rice's claret and blue lingerie from that memorable night in Prague on 7 June 2023 hung from the ceiling like macabre decorations. And in the centre of the room stood a mannequin dressed in a tracksuit, its lifeless eyes staring into the void. As the group tried to understand what they were seeing, a voice pierced the silence, chilling them to the bone. "Hello. My name's David Moyes. Welcome to my domain," it whispered darkly, sending a wave of terror through their souls. Realisation dawned upon them as they understood the truth - the spirits from West Ham becoming Champions of Europe had not left this stadium. Instead, they had found a way to torment the living, forever trapped within the confines of a stadium that they never wanted to leave in the first place.

As the group of unsuspecting Brighton and Hove Albion fans scrambled to escape, the walls closed in around them, the claret and blue lingerie twisting and contorting in a grotesque display of malevolence. And through the darkness, they could hear Declan Rice yelling, "Shoot Jarrod!" which echoed off the encroaching walls, a haunting reminder of the horror Declan's West Ham used to inflict on opponents who dared to tread inside his domain.

Come on You Irons.
