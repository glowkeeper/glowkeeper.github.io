## Gordon E. Moore, Intel Co-Founder Behind Moore’s Law, Dies at 94

Gordon E. Moore, co-founder of Intel and the scientist whose 1965 prediction became known as Moore’s Law, has died at the age of 94. Moore founded Intel Corporation in 1968 and served as its chairman and CEO until 1975. He was the author of the 1965 paper entitled “Cramming more components onto integrated circuits," which became the foundation of Moore’s Law. This law states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years and that the cost of manufacturing transistors goes down as the number of transistors increases. Moore is widely recognized as one of the most important figures in computing history and his work had an immense influence on the advancement of the industry. He helped revolutionize the electronics industry by providing a formula for predicting the future of computer technology. Moore was also a strong believer in responsible corporate stewardship and was an integral part of the company’s transformation from a small start-up to the world’s largest chipmaker. Despite his retirement from Intel in 1997, Moore continued his involvement in the industry and remained an active mentor until his death. He was also a philanthropist, providing significant financial support to education and other causes. Moore will be remembered not just for his groundbreaking work, but also for his commitment to the advancement of the industry and for his generous contributions to the community.
