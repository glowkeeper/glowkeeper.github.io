I met a girl from the college campus,

I liked her, she was a sight to see.

But it took a while, my task was thankless,

‘cause she wouldn’t come out with me.

Because…

She had deadlines.

She had deadlines.

Yeah! She had deadlines.

She had deadlines, so she wasn’t free!

Sounds like an excuse to me….

(Solo)

We went for a coffee on the college campus,

We talked about philosophy.

But on my mind was not Karl Marx,

‘cause she wouldn’t come out with me.

Because…

She had deadlines.

She had deadlines.

Yeah! She had deadlines.

She had deadlines,

So she wasn’t free!

(Solo)

We went for a drink off the college campus,

We had a laugh in the Brighton back streets.

We kissed, at last, on the last bus,

And all because she came out with me.

Because…

She didn’t have deadlines.

She didn’t have deadlines.

Yeah! She didn’t have deadlines.

She didn’t have deadlines,

So she was free!
