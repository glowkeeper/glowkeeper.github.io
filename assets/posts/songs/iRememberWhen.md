I remember when,

You first came home.

You'd sleep on my chest;

Total surrender. I fell in love.

I remember when,

You first went to school.

Your sister, your friend; giggling behind me,

Happy memories. I cherish them all.

I remember when,

To the pool we'd flee.

Splash for joy, fishy, fishy.

Come into my sea.

But into the past, I shouldn't stare.

What's important is now.

Blossoming; a lovely young women,

Let her glow by letting her go.

Her life's hers to fathom,

Watch her confidence grow and grow.

I remember when,

I found a home for me and you.

"Don't like our room, daddy!"

So I painted it pink, from blue.

I remember when,

You started to draw.

My favourite bird; a Peregrine Falcon.

Wild, fast and raw.

I remember when,

You first got on your bike.

You learned to ride it really fast.

But stopping it gave you a fright.

But into the past, I shouldn't stare.

What's important is now.

Blossoming; a lovely young women,

Let her glow by letting her go.

Her life's hers to fathom,

Watch her confidence grow and grow.

I remember when,

You first got on a bus.

Into town; journey without me.

To your freedom, adjust.

I remember when,

You first learned to ski.

Racing down the black run.

At the chair lift, waiting for me.

I remember when,

We went to Hyper Japan.

You dressed up as Edward, looking so cool.

A picture snapped by a fan.

But into the past, I shouldn't stare.

What's important is now.

Blossoming; a lovely young women,

Let her glow by letting her go.

Her life's hers to fathom,

Watch her confidence grow and grow.
