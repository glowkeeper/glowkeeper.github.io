# Golden Brown

I was suffering from a cold and felt a bit sorry for myself when I reimagined the first two lines of the brilliant [Golden Brown](https://genius.com/The-stranglers-golden-brown-lyrics) by The Stranglers.

**Mine**|**Original**
:-------|:-----------
Golden Brown, texture like sun | Golden Brown, texture like sun
Lay me down, so I can die | Lays me down, with my mind she runs
