# Nuts

There's a lot to be got.
From the average nut.

Such as a cashew hews when a pistachio hoes.
And a clove is closed when a Ginkgo goes.

A pecan can because a walnut's not.
And a chia cheers when a poppy's popped.

An almond's on when a mangongo's gone.
And an acorn's scorn at a bunya's bun.

A cedar's do at a pumpkin's skin.
And a paradise cries at a hemp's hymn.

And when a candlestick's gone out.
A lotus pose becomes devout.

But when all is said and done.
The facts of a flax are but mere fun.

The kernel of truth at the very apex.
Is through an open mind in the nut on your neck.
