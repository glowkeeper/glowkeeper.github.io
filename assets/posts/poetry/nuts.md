# Nuts

There's a lot that's clear-cut,
With your seeds, fruit and nuts.

Such as, these,
Little known facts.

The egusi sees when the sesame seeds.
And the breadnut's cut when the quinoa needs.

A cashew hews when a pistachio hoes.
And a clove is closed when a ginkgo goes.

A pecan can because a walnut's not.
And a chia cheers when a poppy's popped.

An almond's on when a mangongo's gone.
And an acorn scorns at a bunya's bun.

A kola di-da at a pumpkin's skin.
And a paradise cries at a hemp's hymn.

A candlestick wick inflames a hickory's hic.
And a lotus pose makes a cocoa kick.

But when all's said and done.
The facts of a flax are but mere fun.

So don't look to food, or even elsewhere,
For righting the wrongs that seem unfair.

For the kernel of truth is there to check.
By opening the mind in the nut on your neck.
