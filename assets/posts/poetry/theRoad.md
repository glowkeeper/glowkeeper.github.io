# The Road Through the Woods

An inversion of Rudyard Kipling's poem, [The Way Through the Woods](https://www.familyfriendpoems.com/poem/the-way-through-the-woods-by-rudyard-kipling).

**Mine**|**Original**
:-------|:-----------
THEY felled the wood to build the road | THEY shut the road through the woods
Many years ago. | Seventy years ago.
Weather and rain have done it again, |  Weather and rain have undone it again,
And now you would never know | And now you would never know
There was once a wood where there's now a path | There was once a path through the woods
Before they chopped down the trees: | Before they planted the trees:
It is underneath the concrete and scree, | It is underneath the coppice and heath,
And the road-builders' decrees.  | And the thin anemones.
Only the locals see | Only the keeper sees
That, where the traffic goes | That, where the ring-dove broods
And the lorries idle at ease, | And the badgers roll at ease,
There was once a wood instead of the road. | There was once a road through the woods.
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
Yet, if you drive on the road | Yet, if you enter the woods
Of a summer evening late | Of a summer evening late,
When the traffic's air gathers in toxic-ringed pools | When the night-air cools on the trout-ring’d pools
Where the otter once whistled his mate | Where the otter whistles his mate
(They fear the men on the road | (They fear not men in the woods
and now they number so few), | Because they see so few),
You will hear the weeze of an old man's chest | You will hear the beat of a horse’s feet
And the cough of a child in the fumes, | And the swish of a skirt in the dew,
Steadily breaking through | Steadily cantering through
The smoggy multitidues, | The misty solitudes,
Where once the locals knew | As though they perfectly knew
The old lost trees ripped down by the road ... | The old lost road through the woods ...
Where once stood a wood goes the road. | But there is no road through the woods.
