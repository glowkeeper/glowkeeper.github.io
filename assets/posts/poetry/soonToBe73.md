# Soon To Be 73

<br />

An NHS spin on Shakespeare's poem about ageing: [Sonnet 73](http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/shakesonnets/section4/).

**Mine**|**Original**
:-------|:-----------
That time of year when winter air unfolds | That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When grey skies, or rain, or snow, over Britain hang | When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
Upon the sick who shiver against the cold, |  Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
Bare ruined wards, where once nurses' hearts sang. | Bare ruin’d choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
Healthcare sees the twilight of decay | In me thou seest the twilight of such day
As after glory fades the NHS, | As after sunset fadeth in the west,
Which by and by the Tories stole away, | Which by and by black night doth take away,
Sold off, the market steals away the rest. | Death’s second self, that seals up all in rest.
Witness the embers of her once great fire  | In me thou see’st the glowing of such fire
And on the ashes of her youth we cry, | That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
As the death-bed beckons her to soon expire | As the death-bed whereon it must expire
Consumed by greed which used her to profit by. | Consumed with that which it was nourish’d by.
I witness that, which makes my love grow strong, | This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,
To love that well which got cashed-out for a song. | To love that well which thou must leave ere long.
