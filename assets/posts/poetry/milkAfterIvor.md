# Milk After Ivor

An early start,
For Corrageen,
In the heart,
Of Ireland,
A perfect place,
To catch up,
With family,
And dear friends.

At the airport,
Meet in the bar,
Just eggs for me,
But beer, for some;
Holiday's begun!
Then hurrying!
Board the flight!
To Celtic delight!

Arrive midday,
Two on the bus,
Everyone else,
In the car,
Windy and wet,
Off we set,
Via a Lidl stop,
First of many.

Arrive at last,
Eleven fed,
And watered,
Then we venture,
'cross the stream,
And the bog,
Through the ferns,
Up to White Rock.

Off to bed,
And a shed,
And a cupboard,
Whatever works,
It doesn't matter,
Constant chatter,
Enjoy being,
All together.

To Blackwater,
Curious seal,
Head above waves,
Stealing a peek,
At the humans,
Beachcombing,
For sea shells,
On the seashore.

Edenvale woods,
Trees straddle brook,
Waterfalls,
Old mill walls,
Wild mushrooms,
Pooh stick race,
Teddy on the gate,
A message of hope.

In the garden,
Stood stock-still,
Hoping to see,
Hen Harrier,
Against the hills,
Which were mountains,
To small legs,
That aren't small now.

Now a dozen,
Juggling balls,
Moonlight Sonata,
Classical Guitar,
Czech songs,
Wonderwall,
Hallelujah,
Lots of laughter.

Then fourteen,
An afternoon,
At the house,
Eating, drinking,
Kin keeping,
Try headstands,
And handstands.
New yew pendants.

Evening walk,
Down cowpat lane,
But the cows came,
Townies tamed.
Then Mischa herds,
Courage inspired,
Down we race,
To the fairy place.

In the morning,
Up the (mountain),
Blueberry pickings,
I stop counting,
The ravens soar,
Over those ahead,
Sail the wind,
On rocky crag.

Kris can't come,
Fat pad contusion,
Good punk band name,
Fat Pad Concussion,
"I'm gonna do,
What I ***king want!,
Dance, sing, act,
Like I forgot!".

In the evening,
Pretty Duncannon,
Windswept and wild,
Eyes full of sand,
Kitesurfers jumping,
Then Dunbrody Abbey,
Shots of Kris and me,
Looking happy.

Hook Head Lighthouse,
Don't shine for us,
Road closed,
For an Irish hour.
We opt instead,
For Baginbun Bay,
Beautifully fresh,
On a rainy day.

On the way home,
Stop off in town,
At the bloody Lidl.
For milk after Ivor,
Shows us 'round,
His building site,
That one day might,
Become his home.

Two new faces,
To new places;
St Mullin's Mill.
Artists arting,
Dozens around,
Retreat my ground,
A Guinness found,
In the local pub.

A brief break,
In the weather,
A slim chance,
For a fire,
So we danced,
And we blew,
And she rose,
Toast Marshmallows.

Another Lidl run,
For birthday,
Provisions.
Then up the hill,
While Pavlova,
(or a meringue),
Was baked,
In their honour.

In the morning,
UK beckoning,
Lots of crying,
At people leaving,
But it's not the end,
it's just goodbye,
Until we meet again,
In Corrageen.
