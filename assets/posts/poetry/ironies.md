# Ironies

2022! A standout year.
Society's platform starting to shear.
Covid, Inflation, Climate, Ukraine.
A new PM again, again and again.

But this isn't about all that big stuff,
Many have commented there enough.
I'm talking on a scale much more easily grasped,
About the stuff that has affected _my_ arse.
All the people that have come,
And those that have gone.
All the losses, the gains,
And the things that changed.
About the shifts that have affected _me_.
And all the different ironies.

First, the thing that changed the most.
The thing that haunts me - like a ghost.
My kids decided to ditch _me_,
To their mother, they did flee.
An absent father's often the game.
That's always sad and such a shame.
But my kids have absented _me_.
Oh, the bitter irony.

I no longer hear my youngests' tales,
No longer part of her travails.
She'd been ill (very seriously).
For a decade (or more), I'd worried;
She's much better now, Thankfully
Growing into a young lady,
That I wasn't sure I'd ever see.
But instead of losing her - _she's ditched me_.
Oh, the bitter irony.

My eldest - an accusation put,
That I'd been inappropriate.
When she was just half the height of me.
Not much higher than my knee.
How incorrect could she have been?
With that charge thrown at me.
Before she slept, I'd bounce on her bed,
So she laughed, happy dreams, Instead
of nightmares, I wanted in her head,
As she lay there and slept.
So the blame tossed thoughtlessly,
Stung me more than any killer bee.
The problem is that she'd looked back,
With older eyes than she'd had,
At the time I'd bounced on her bed.
So sweet dreams went into her head.

We've since tried a regenesis,
She told me she'd missed her little sis',
Fair enough! I understood the miss!
But there was something else, remiss,
At school, consequences they'd learned,
The effects, as far as she was concerned?
She said she wanted them righted.
But her approach was clumsy, short-sighted.
The actual consequence? For us?
It's not back, but forever thus.
Because our unbreakable bond?
Not steadfast; that's been carpet-bombed.
Our connection? No longer free.
Oh, the bitter irony.

In December, I lost my mum.
And though I wasn't as close as some,
Don't want to sully her name in prose,
Especially with her death so close.
Besides, no matter what she'd done,
She was still me' mum.
What's more, I'd told her before she passed.
Right near the end - the very last.
That the past? I'd forgiven.
No more our connection riven.
For that? I close my eyes, pleased.
"May your restless mind rest in peace".

Before she died, a Christmas card she sent,
To the girls, with some cash to spend,
When they opened it,
On their Yule visit,
It made me think of her,
My mind; a sad, lonely blur.
It gave me a moments pause,
To reflect; thank you Santa Claus.

The card said this:

"Have a super Christmas, treat yourself and let us know what you did (even if it is only 'stuck it in the bank')."

Brief, to the point, and unusually frank,
She wanted to hear of her grandchild's pranks.
She wanted to hear from them some more.
To have some vicarious fun, Before
she could hear from them no more.
Having left a life done for.

My eldest forgot that card,
When she returned just as fast,
As she could, to her mum,
After calling for Christmas fun.
Yet, she still had her Granddad,
To inform of the fun she'd had.
I can't help but think about that hard.
And the neglect makes me sad.
Can't help but wonder, "why so reckless?"
With the people that love her the best?
Is it my fault, somehow?
Is it too late to change that now?
Is history repeating itself?
'cause they've consigned me to a dusty shelf?
I wasn't very close to mum,
I wasn't her favourite son.
Now my daughters aren't close to _me_.
On different grounds, as far as I can see?
But, oh! The bitter irony.

(An addendum, in '23,
Written soon after my birthday,
And another card catastrophe,
My kids didn't send one to me.
They must've thought their duty done.
When they were cajoled to come,
The weekend before the happy day,
To give me presents and to celebrate.
But I'd always encouraged them,
To draw a thoughtful, considered gem.
So the person who got the card,
Knew we were thinking of them hard.
So the lack made me suspect then,
I wasn't special. But condemned.
That was confirmed when best wishes,
Only came with the night and the witches,
Tainting a day that should have been great,
Because I then admitted my fate,
Had been sealed. Not loved much anymore.
And that realisation hurt me more.
The love I'd given, not given back to me.
Oh, the bitter irony.)

Enough! My year wasn't _all_ rough.
There were lots of good stuff!

First, I changed a job I disliked,
I even managed to end it right!
Without my usual venomous spite,
When I left and turned out the light.
I used to tell them what's what;
Always a silly, childish plot.
Gosh! Get the softer, nicer me!
Oh, the happy irony!

Then, I made some great new friends,
Who view life through a left-leaning lens,
Invariably the most welcoming men,
Kind, thoughtful and caring gems.
And on the golf course! Of all places!
Often, not an enlightened oasis!
Goes to show you can find traces,
Of good amongst all the angry faces.
Of good, amidst the tyranny,
Oh, the happy irony.

And the thing that's proven most?
That amidst the times morose,
Some good can usually take host,
And help banish nightmarish ghosts!
My missus, and her boy, moved in,
No longer empty, without children.
Some problems? Ahead, we saw some,
But it's been totally awesome.
She's loving, supportive and kind,
I'm a lucky boy to have her on my side.
And now the house feels fun again.
A new spirit in a new den.

And so,
Although,
My kids dismissed,
My loving kiss.
And mum has gone.
A new song,
Has sprung from me,
A year dramatic for society.
A mix of bad and good for me,
'cause of all its different ironies.
