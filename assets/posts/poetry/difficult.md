Drawing poetic inspiration from [David Shrigley's](http://davidshrigley.com/) downbeat disclosure.

**Mine**|**Original**
:-------|:-----------
It is my desire, | IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY DESIRE
To write wonderful poetry. | TO WRITE POETRY
But my attempts, |  BUT I FIND IT
Always end woefully | INCREDIBLY FUCKING DIFFICULT
