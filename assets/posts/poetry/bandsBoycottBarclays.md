# Bands Boycott Barclays

Bands Boycott Barclays,
At The Great Escape,
Can't help thinking, "A mistake!".
Yet, I'm conflicted!
'cause listen - there's a part of me,
That agrees,
That a protest,
In these times of distress,
Is progress;
'cause we're so suppressed!
And votes cause no reset!
Why no civil unrest?
I mean, "For fuck's sake!",
What will it take?
How bad must it get?
Before something's said.
So I sort of get the "Boycott" play,
When it's hard to say,
"Enough! Not in my name!".
But its only impact? Really?
Was to folk like me,
Those with tickets erased;
Us gig-going folk,
Who grind through a Britain broke,
Deprived of a weekend to thrive,
Of a weekend to dance and jive,
In an otherwise mundane life.
So please - next time,
A different target find!
Other conspirators pick!
Leave us to celebrate our new music.
Instead, come and play,
Use your platform to say,
To the folk who'd already paid,
"Fuck Barclays, Fuck genocide",
"Fuck all the other bullshit besides",
So instead of "Bands Boycott Barclays",
We all do.
