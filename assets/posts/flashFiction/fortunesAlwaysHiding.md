# Fortunes Always Hiding

I wasn’t allowed to go. Apparently, I was too young. I’m still uncertain whether my mum bought me a large West Ham flag, and the FA Cup Final kit, to appease her guilt or to dry my tears.

With the thrill of watching Trev’ fall over to make it 1-0 (a lead the team never gave up), I almost forgot my disappointment. But not quite.

To celebrate the win, I climbed the tallest tree on our street and waved my flag at every passing car. I waved it again at each toot of a horn. And then I made two vows. First - to go to the very next FA Cup Final in which my team played. Secondly - if I ever had children, to take them along too.

I had to wait for a generation to fulfil the first of my dreams, and even Stevie G’s blasted last-minute equaliser didn’t (entirely) ruin my day.

Just my second vow remains. Fortunately, my children have often blown bubbles at Upton Park (and now the Olympic Stadium), so we now share the same wish for Wembley glory. And every time the FA Cup comes around, I pray that our dreams do not Fade and Die.
