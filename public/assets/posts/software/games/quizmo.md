[Quizmo](https://quizmo.fun/) throws 10 rapid-fire questions your way, and every answer is a number from 1 to 25. It is fast, intuitive, and oh-so-satisfying.

💥 Tap your answers on one of four sleek button layouts—a 5x5 grid, a 3x4x5x6x7 pyramid, a daily random and a super random layout that randomises per question! With each, the top left button is 1, and the bottom right is 25.

⏱️ You have just 10 seconds per question. The faster you tap, the higher you score—no pressure...okay, maybe a little!

✅ Correct answers on the grid score you the time left to answer. The pyramid adds 10% to that. Random adds 20%. Super Random, 30%. You can only play one layout per day, so choose wisely!

🔥 And here is the kicker: a fresh batch of questions drops daily. Correct—new challenges, new bragging rights, every single day.

Think fast. Tap faster. Dominate the layouts. [Quizmo](https://quizmo.fun/) awaits.
