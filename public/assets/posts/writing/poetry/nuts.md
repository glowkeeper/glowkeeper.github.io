# Nuts

|             |
| :-----------|
| There's a lot that's clear-cut, |
| With your seeds, fruit and nuts. |
| &nbsp; |
| Such as, these, |
| Little known facts. |
| &nbsp; |
| The egusi sees when the sesame seeds. |
| And the breadnut's cut when the quinoa needs. |
| &nbsp; |
| A cashew hews when a pistachio hoes. |
| And a clove is closed when a ginkgo goes. |
| &nbsp; |
| A pecan can because a walnut's not. |
| And a chia cheers when a poppy's popped. |
| &nbsp; |
| An almond's on when a mangongo's gone. |
| And an acorn scorns at a bunya's bun. |
| &nbsp; |
| A kola di-da at a pumpkin's skin. |
| And a paradise cries at a hemp's hymn. |
| &nbsp; |
| A candlestick wick inflames a hickory's hic. |
| And a lotus pose makes a cocoa kick. |
| &nbsp; |
| But when all's said and done. |
| The facts of a flax are but mere fun. |
| &nbsp; |
| So don't look to food, or even elsewhere, |
| For righting the wrongs that seem unfair. |
| &nbsp; |
| For the kernel of truth is there to check. |
| By opening the mind in the nut on your neck. |
