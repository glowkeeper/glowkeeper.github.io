# I Be Averse

A new take Philip Larkin's [This Be The Verse](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48419/this-be-the-verse).

**Mine**|**Original**
:-------|:-----------
They fuck you up, your sons and daughters. | They fuck you up, your mum and dad.
They may not mean to, but they do. | They may not mean to, but they do.
They blame you come hell and high waters, | They fill you with the faults they had
And add some extra to scapegoat you. | And add some extra, just for you.
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
But they fucked up mostly by themselves. | But they were fucked up in their turn
With mates in new-style hats and coats, | By fools in old-style hats and coats,
Who sanctioned them while raising hell, | Who half the time were soppy-stern
And all the while at each other's throats. | And half at one another’s throats.
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
The child throws misery at parents. | Man hands on misery to man.
It deepens like a shadowed shelf. | It deepens like a coastal shelf.
Stay out and keep your innocence, | Get out as early as you can,
And don't have any kids yourself. | And don’t have any kids yourself.
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
(or: do have kids and accept your fate) | &nbsp;
