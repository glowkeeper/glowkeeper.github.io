# Thankless

|             |
| :-----------|
| Locking the door that doesn't shut, |
| You'd imagine a thankless task. But, |
| It's the act that counts. So clearly, |
| Those thankless tasks aren't nearly, |
| As desperate as they might appear, |
| To anyone who arrived here, |
| With a misguided mode of thinking, |
| With an unhealthy taste for winning. |
| So, don't think, "I must be number one!", |
| Instead, delight in a process done. |
| Then, a thankless task becomes thankful, |
| Besides, that door might lock after all! |
