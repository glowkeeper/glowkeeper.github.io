# Gregorian Song

|:--------------------------------|
| Joyless January, |
| The bluest of Mondays. |
| Fresh February, |
| Flipping pancake day. |
| The madness of March, |
| The vernal equinox. |
| Awakening April, |
| Showers plentiful, |
| Miraculous May, |
| And fecund fire play. |
| Warm, joyous June, |
| The solstice moon. |
| Optimistic July, |
| Mood bright as the skies. |
| August August, |
| Face up, we must, |
| To jealous September, |
| And hot days surrendered. |
| Restless October, |
| When gales blow over. |
| Enraged November, |
| Guy Fawkes' embers, |
| Enchanted December, |
| Yuletides to remember, |
| And grateful sanctuary, |
| From joyless January... |
