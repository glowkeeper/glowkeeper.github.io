|:--------------------------------|
| When I looked up at the sky, |
| In the corner of my eye, |
| Something passing way up high, |
| A UFO I thought I spied! |
| &nbsp; |
| It must be something more mundane, |
| A bird, a star, an aeroplane? |
| But such a shock! I exclaimed! |
| "It's that ****ing pen' of Harry Kane!" |
