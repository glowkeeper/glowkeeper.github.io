# stories from the campfire

Every July (until Covid), [Brighton Buddhist Centre](https://www.brightonbuddhistcentre.co.uk/) held a family gathering at the [Rivendell Retreat Centre](https://www.rivendellretreatcentre.com/), near Uckfield in East Sussex, UK.

On the final evening, all the families met for a barbecue at the retreat campfire. Afterward, they sang songs and ate toasted bread that the children baked in the fire. Then someone told a story that they had written during the week. [stories from the campfire](https://stevehuckle.gitbook.io/stories-from-the-campfire) is a collection of those stories.
