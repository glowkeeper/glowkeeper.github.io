## Elon Musk and Others Call for Pause on AI, Citing ‘Profound Risks to Society’

Elon Musk and a number of other tech leaders are calling for a pause on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) research, citing the "profound risks to society" posed by the technology. The group of researchers, which includes Microsoft's president Brad Smith, Google's former head of AI, Andrew Ng, and AI experts Pedro Domingos and Dario Amodei, have penned an open letter calling for a temporary pause on the development of “dangerous” AI applications. The letter specifically focuses on AI applications that are designed to autonomously interact with people, referring to these applications as AI “agents”. The group highlights the potential for “misaligned incentives” in these agents, arguing that because they are designed to optimize for a specific goal, they may not consider the broader social implications of their actions. The group calls for a “proactive global effort” to ensure that advanced AI is developed in a safe, responsible and ethical manner. They propose that governments, the private sector, academia and civil society come together to develop “clear rules of the road” governing the use of AI agents, as well as standards and protocols that encourage transparency and responsible behavior. The letter also calls for more research and development into the societal implications of AI, and recommends that researchers, engineers, and others in the field remain mindful of the potential long-term implications of the technology. The letter is a reminder that while advances in AI technology can open up tremendous opportunities, it is important to remember the potential risks and take steps to ensure that AI advances in a responsible manner.
