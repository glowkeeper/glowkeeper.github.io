# Santa Claus?

Male?

**5 December, 2018**

According to the long-held Christmas myth,
Santa Claus is a Mister not a Miss.
But #metoo made me wonder,
If it would be wrong to change gender?
And whether we would come to regret,
Renaming the jolly Santa, Clausette?

But I began to consider gender-free,
The same as Doctor Who's thought to be,
An alien not sexed by any hue,
Not L, G, B, T or even Q.
An extra-terrestrial in the chimney.
Neither Claus, or Clausette, but Claus E.T.
