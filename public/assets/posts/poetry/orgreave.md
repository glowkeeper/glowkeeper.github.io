A couple of miles, a couple of miles, | HALF a league, half a league,
A couple of miles onward, | Half a league onward,
All in the field at Orgreave | All in the valley of Death
Strode the eight thousand five hundred. | Rode the six hundred.
'Stand strong, stop those lorries!' | 'Forward, the Light Brigade!
Delivering coal from the quarries: | Charge for the guns!' he said:
Into the field at Orgreave | Into the valley of Death
Strode the eight thousand five hundred. | Rode the six hundred.
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
'Stand strong, stop those lorries!' | 'Forward, the Light Brigade!'
Was there a resolve weakened? | Was there a man dismay'd?
Even when the miners knew | Not tho' the soldier knew
Someone who'd been beaten:  | Some one had blunder'd:
Theirs was to not comply, | Their's not to make reply,
Theirs was to reason why, | Their's not to reason why,
Where forth the State's war cry? | Their's but to do and die:
Into the field at Orgreave | Into the valley of Death
Strode the eight thousand five hundred. | Rode the six hundred.
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
Baton to the right of them, | Cannon to right of them,
Baton to the left of them, | Cannon to left of them,
Baton in front of them | Cannon in front of them
Battered and bloodied; | Volley'd and thunder'd;
Stormed at by short shields as well, | Storm'd at with shot and shell,
Boldly they strode and fell, | Boldly they rode and well,
Into the cordon trapped, | Into the jaws of Death,
State sounding the Death Knell  | Into the mouth of Hell
Strode the eight thousand five hundred. | Rode the six hundred.
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
Drew all their batons bare, | Flash'd all their sabres bare,
Cries rang out through the air  | Flash'd as they turn'd in air
Baton charge the pickets there, | Sabring the gunners there,
Charging the miners, while | Charging an army, while
The British Public wondered: | All the world wonder'd:
Bludgeoned without provoke | Plunged in the battery-smoke
The livelihoods of thousands broke; | Right thro' the line they broke;
Yorkshire and Lancs men | Cossack and Russian
Reeled from the baton stroke | Reel'd from the sabre-stroke
Shattered and bloodied. | Shatter'd and sunder'd.
Then they strode back, but not | Then they rode back, but not
Not the eight thousand five hundred. | Not the six hundred.
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
Baton to the right of them, | Cannon to right of them,
Baton to the left of them,  | Cannon to left of them,
Baton behind them  | Cannon behind them
Battered and bloodied; | Volley'd and thunder'd;
Stormed at by short shields as well, | Storm'd at with shot and shell,
While all about them heroes fell, | While horse and hero fell,
Those that had withstood hell  | They that had fought so well
Came through the cordon trapped, | Came thro' the jaws of Death,
Back from the State Death Knell, | Back from the mouth of Hell,
The few that was left of them, | All that was left of them,
Left of eight thousand five hundred. | Left of six hundred.
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
When will the truth be known? | When can their glory fade?
Oh the wild charges done! | O the wild charge they made!
The British Public wondered: | All the world wonder'd.
Why on earth the State Stampede? | Honour the charge they made!
Honour those at Orgreave, | Honour the Light Brigade,
Noble eight thousand five hundred! | Noble six hundred!
