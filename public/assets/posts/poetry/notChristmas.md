'Twas the night before Christmas, when in many a house | 'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
All the creatures were stirring, including the mouse; | Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
All their stockings were hung, but not over here, | The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In the hope that St. Nicholas would not reappear; | In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
My children were snuggled in my ex's beds, | The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
Where I wondered what visions danced in their heads; | While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
Their mum in her mischief, left me with a gap, | And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
And settled my girls away from my lap, | Had just settled down for a long winter's nap,
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
When out on the street there arose noise and clatter, | When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
So I jumped out of bed to see what was the matter. | I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I ran with a dash, | Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the curtains to witness, abashed. | Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
The streetlights shining on a festive road show | The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
And a lustre of fun about the people below, | Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,
So what to my saddened eyes did appear, | When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a scene celebrating that time of year, | But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
With a tipple of brandy, so lively and quick, | With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment, they were toasting St. Nick. | I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
But not in this house! My mind thought aflame, | More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
As through clenched teeth, I swore at his name; | And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
"No DASHER! No DANCER! No PRANCER! No VIXEN! | "Now, DASHER! now, DANCER! now, PRANCER and VIXEN!
No COMET! No CUPID! No DONNER! No BLITZEN! | On, COMET! on CUPID! on, DONNER and BLITZEN!
Be gone from my porch! Do not lean on my wall! | To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!" | Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
I screamed through the window, with tears in my eyes, | As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
Looking up to the heavens, I cried out "Why?", | When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,
On this day, of all days, could I not share with you, | So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
The joy when you open all your toys, too. | With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too.
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
And then, in a twinkling, I saw in my mind | And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and cheering at each little find. | The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was churning around, | As I drew in my hand, and was turning around,
The joy of St.Nicholas, celebrations unbound. | Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
Then in rushed the real world, with a stamp of my foot! | He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
When I looked across the room, where the tree would have stood; | And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
No toys in their wrappings, or lights shining full, | A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
No turkey, or stuffing, or crackers to pull. | And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
My gaze lowered. My mood wasn't merry! | His eyes -- how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
As my cheeks glowered with a temper of fury! | His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
My scornful thin lips, drawn down like a bow, | His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
My unshaven chin, gave my face a shadow; | And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
The stump of a rollup, held tight in my teeth, | The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke rung around me like a funeral wreath; | And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;
My thin face and middle-aged pot-belly, | He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when I cried, like a a sad bowl of jelly. | That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly.
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
I am chubby, I thought, loathing myself, | He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
I looked as sad, and as loathsome, as Harry's house-elf; | And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
I rubbed my eyes, shook my head, | A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
That day had arrived I was fearing with dread; | Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
I spoke not a word, so my mind set to work, | He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
Feeling worthless and hopeless. A useless jerk, | And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,
Then a ring broke the silence. My mind froze, | And laying his finger aside of his nose,
But with a nod, the better side of me chose; | And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
To spring to my phone, and answer its whistle, | He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And at the other end, my daughters' excitement bristled. | And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
And I heard them exclaim, with all their might, | But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
HAPPY CHRISTMAS DADDY! DID YOU HAVE A GOOD NIGHT? | HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT!
