# Old Eton

For far too long,
From Old Eton,
The class system,
Has banged the drum.

For far too long,
From Old Eton,
Life's cruel songs,
Dance servile throngs.

For Far Too Long,
Has Old Eton,
Been champion,
Without question.

For Far Too Long,
Has Old Eton,
Sneered down upon,
Folk of Britain.

"Modern" Britain,
It saddens me,
Cancelled, cruel,
Sans any empathy.

The time has come,
For New Britain,
To bang the drum,
Of new systems.

The time has come,
For New Britain,
Uplifting songs,
Danced by equal sons.

The time has come,
For New Britain,
New bastions,
Earned champions.

The time has come,
Forge New Britain,
Empathic sons,
Unite women.

Modern Britain,
I wish to see,
Woke, kind and full,
Of loving empathy.
