I wish you were a monkey,<br/>
That I could scratch behind the ears,<br/>
I would feed you lots of 'nanas,<br/>
And hug away your years.

I'd pretend to be a lion,<br/>
As we wrestled on the ground,<br/>
Strong, fearless, gentle, proud and wise<br/>
My hero I have found.

Then I'd cling to you tightly,<br/>
As you climbed into the trees,<br/>
I'd fall asleep amidst your calm,<br/>
Delight, the midnight breeze.

But now I'm home, alone again,<br/>
A monkey? Not really my wish!<br/>
Just a present father's love,<br/>
A dad to spend time with.

Instead, you're at your office,<br/>
Or in a soulless airport lounge,<br/>
Away from home yet again,<br/>
Your time I have to scrounge.

I don't think it's much to ask,<br/>
To want you home sometimes for tea,<br/>
After we'd play-fight, and run,<br/>
And then you'd read to me.

Then I'd cling to you tightly,<br/>
You climb in beside me, please!<br/>
I'd fall asleep amidst your calm,<br/>
Delight, your mighty squeeze.
