# Dreamland

A new take on Blake's great poem, [Jerusalem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/54684/jerusalem-and-did-those-feet-in-ancient-time). What would a divine spirit make of modern England?

:-------|:-----------
And would those feet in modern times | And did those feet in ancient time
Walk upon England's mountains unclean: | Walk upon Englands mountains green:
And would the Divine Spirit of God, |  And was the holy Lamb of God,
On England's monoculture pastures gleam! | On Englands pleasant pastures seen!
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
And would the Countenance Divine, | And did the Countenance Divine,
Shine forth on our barb-wired hills? | Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And would a Dreamland get built here, | And was Jerusalem builded here,
Among these dark Satanic Landfills? | Among these dark Satanic Mills?
 &nbsp; | &nbsp;
Bring me my Barrels of black gold: | Bring me my Bow of burning gold:
Bring me every object I desire: | Bring me my arrows of desire:
Bring me, my Army, oil fields you stole! | Bring me my Spear: O clouds unfold!
Bring me my World on fire! | Bring me my Chariot of fire!
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
I will not bow, or Cease to Fight, | I will not cease from Mental Fight,
Nor shall my words sleep from my hand: | Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand:
Until a Dreamland rises from the ground, | Till we have built Jerusalem,
In England's unclean, unpleasant Land. | In Englands green & pleasant Land.
