# Winter

<br />

A sombre reworking of Shakespeare's poem, [Winter](https://www.shmoop.com/winter-shakespeare/poem-text.html).

<br />

**Mine**|**Original**
:-------|:-----------
When the rain never stops to fall, | When icicles hang by the wall,
And Dick the bin man shelters from the hail, | And Dick the shepherd blows his nail,
And Tom mends the radiator in the hall, | And Tom bears logs into the hall,
And frozen food's delivered from the sale; | And milk comes frozen home in pail;
When toes are chilled, and the weather's foul, | When blood is nipp'd, and ways be foul,
Then nightly do the homeless prowl, | Then nightly sings the staring owl,
"What if it were you?"— | "Tu-whit, to-who!"—
A sombre note, | A merry note,
While weary Joan does chance her lot. | While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
When all aloud the wind does blow, | When all aloud the wind doth blow,
And coughing drowns the busker's score, | And coughing drowns the parson's saw,
And tourists ride the mountain's snow, | And birds sit brooding in the snow,
And Marian's throat rasps red and raw; | And Marian's nose looks red and raw;
When roasted duck fills deep the bowl, | When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
Then nightly do the homeless prowl, | Then nightly sings the staring owl,
"What if it were you?"— | "Tu-whit, to-who!"—
A sombre note, | A merry note,
While weary Joan does chance her lot. | While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
