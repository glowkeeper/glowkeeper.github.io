# Gregorian Song

Joyless January,
Doesn't do much for me.
Feckless February,
Still no sanctuary.
The madness of March,
Day and night match.
And grateful April,
Brings showers, until,
Miraculous May,
And fecund fire play.
Warm, joyous June,
Hot midsummer swoon.
Optimistic July,
Mood bright as the skies.
August August,
Face up, we must,
To jealous September,
The hot days surrendered.
Restless October,
Summer's finally over.
Enraged November,
Bends all of the timber,
Enchanted December,
Yuletides to remember,
And warm, grateful shelter,
From Mother Earth's temper.
