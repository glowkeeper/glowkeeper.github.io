# Gregorian Song

Joyless January,
The bluest of Mondays.
Feckless February,
Flipping pancake day.
The madness of March,
The vernal equinox.
Grateful April,
Brings showers, until,
Miraculous May,
And fecund fire play.
Warm, joyous June,
The solstice moon.
Optimistic July,
Mood bright as the skies.
August August,
Face up, we must,
To jealous September,
And hot days surrendered.
Restless October,
When gales blow over.
Enraged November,
Guy Fawkes' embers,
Enchanted December,
Yuletides to remember,
And warm, grateful shelter,
From Mother Earth's temper.
