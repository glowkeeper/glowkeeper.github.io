# Balls Shmalls

Golf balls are contrary things.
And it's not just the ball that spins,
In the wrong 'king direction, fool!
Towards a lie that's unplayable.
'cause also daubed on the outer rim,
Usually, some bullshit marketing.
'cause the balls inscribed "distance" don't.
And those that reckon "soft feel" aren't.
And the ones that remark "velocity"?
Don't seem to go very fast to me!
The only thing that seems certain,
(as far as I can determine),
Is that the ball, as a rule,
Won't fall into the 'king hole,
Whenever I hit a 'king putt.
Expecting the hole with my ball stuffed!
So don't stress over contrary spin,
Ignore all the bullshit marketing,
And all the shite that means 'kall,
Just hit the 'king incompliant ball,
To the utmost best of your ability,
And wherever it flies! It shall be!
And wow! If it drops into the 'king hole,
Well, you're a 'king lucky soul!
But if, as is normal for most of us,
Good shots are as rare as a StageCoach bus,
Well, you're unlikely to sink a hole-in-one.
But don't worry! Don't get highly strung!
'cause, no matter what, when all's said and done,
 It's just a 'king game! And it's supposed to be fun!
