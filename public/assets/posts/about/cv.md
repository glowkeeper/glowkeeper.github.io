# Dr Steve Huckle

I am an accomplished developer, educated to doctoral level, who has found the joy of teaching; it's a wonderful opportunity to pass on experience and evolve the next generation of computing professionals.

## Professional Profile

I am currently a Visiting Tutor at the University of Roehampton, where I have been teaching Foundation Year students how to conduct research and [introducing them to building games](https://github.com/glowkeeper/IntroToBuilding3DGamesInUnity). Before that, I was a Lecturer in Computer Graphics and Computer Science at the University of Sussex, where I taught students the Unity games engine and the fundamentals of a 3D space.

My career in computing began in the early 1990s. After earning a distinction for my bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I worked as a UNIX Systems Administrator. I then ran my own web-based business, streaming DJ mixes online. That sparked an interest in digital music, so in 2003 I undertook a master's degree in Music Technology. That led to my becoming an Audio Programmer in games, where I worked on various released titles.

I then returned to the web space as a freelance web programmer, before a friend asked me to build a Bitcoin mining rig for them sometime around 2013. I have since completed a [PhD](/academia/phd) that focused on blockchains, where my [thesis](/assets/docs/pHDThesis.pdf) used design science research to ask whether the technology could help overcome some of the most urgent problems facing humanity. In short, blockchains might _help_, but it is impossible to solve all of humanity's issues through technology; we must also change political, economic, and cultural goals. However, the best outcome from my PhD was that it introduced me to academia and the joys of teaching.

## Experience

- Five years as Module Convenor of [Programming for 3D](https://github.com/glowkeeper/p3d), a third-year undergraduate and postgraduate games programming course at the University of Sussex
- Five years of programming within the games industry, where I worked on four completed titles
- I have been writing full-stack Javascript since 2016 – React frontends. Node.js, Express, MySQL backends
- I have a decade of experience with blockchains, including four years researching the technology as part of a PhD
- Many years of freelance computing experience, during which I created and maintained many websites
- Early in my professional career, I was a UNIX Systems Administrator. I maintain strong Linux and Mac command-line skills
