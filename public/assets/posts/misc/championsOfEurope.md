# Champions of Europe

I'm writing this a few days after returning from [Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague), where I watched my team, [West Ham](https://www.whufc.com/), [win the Europa Conference League final](https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaconferenceleague/news/0278-15f574835e19-5f18d342d950-1000--west-ham-meet-the-europa-conference-league-winners/). "European champions! We know what we are!".

Ever since West Ham qualified for the competition and I realised the final would be in Prague, I'd had the occasion in my mind because, if West Ham made it that far, it would be an opportunity not only to witness my team's first European final in nearly fifty years but also to check in with some family and friends; after all, my girlfriend's sister, Katka, lives in Prague, just a ten-minute walk from where the final would be played. And my old friend Nathan lives in [Brno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno), about a three-hour bus or train ride south of Prague.

So when [West Ham beat AZ Alkmaar and made the final](https://www.skysports.com/football/news/37002/12882756/az-alkmaar-0-1-west-ham-agg-1-3-david-moyes-takes-hammers-into-europa-conference-league-final), all the pieces fell into place. Except, I didn't have a ticket. Unfortunately, that wasn't going to be easy to remedy because [Slavia Prague's Fortuna Arena](https://en.slavia.cz/zobraz.asp?t=klub-fortuna-arena), the venue for the final, only holds twenty-thousand; that might sound a lot, but consider that West Ham's average home gate is sixty-two thousand, their ticket allocation for the final was just five thousand and that they hadn't won a trophy for many years - tickets for the game were going to be in high demand!

My first attempt to find a ticket ended with my getting scammed for €395 via an advertisement on a [Czech online marketplace](https://www.bazos.cz/) (fortunately, my bank reckons they will get the money back). I then found some tickets advertised on eBay and got into a lengthy conversation with the seller on WhatsApp; to cut a long story short, I decided not to buy those because I figured it was probably a scam, too. Finally, I resorted to the ticket reseller sites [Ticombo](https://www.ticombo.com) and [Livefootballtickets](https://www.livefootballtickets.com/), both of whom guarantee your money, which I decided was an excellent thing given my experience up to that point. However, they both charge huge fees, so the advertised tickets for the final were expensive! In fact, they had been a little bit out of my range until, on the late Saturday evening before the week of the game, up popped a ticket on Ticombo that, while still super expensive, was a good deal cheaper than any I had seen up until that point. I took the plunge...

However, the ticket didn't actually arrive until I was sat on the Gatwick runway on Monday morning, waiting for my flight to take off to [Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna) - all a bit nerve-wracking, so you can imagine my delight when, just before take off, it finally appeared in the UEFA ticketing mobile app'! Off to Prague I was headed, ticket in hand!

On the flight, I sat between another West Ham fan (there were plenty onboard) and a sustainability researcher. After reminiscing about the few occasions West Ham had nearly won something with the fan, I got into an interesting chat with the researcher about the merits of carbon tax credits; in short, apparently, the amount of carbon companies are allowed to burn before they're taxed is currently too high, so the credits are next to meaningless. And the irony of the researcher sitting onboard an aircraft that burns vast amounts of fossil fuels did not escape either of us; however, he was mitigating his conscience by paying for meaningful carbon offsetting schemes in Uganda, which had added an extra €50 to the cost of his flight (as opposed to the €2 I had spent supposedly offsetting my carbon, a figure we decided probably meant my offsetting was nothing short of greenwash).

Having landed, I found my bus stop for my ongoing €13 trip to Brno, and a lovely air-conditioned and comfortable [Flixbus](https://www.flixbus.co.uk/) arrived on time, which, as a Brit used to stuffy, late and over-priced coach travel, was an unusual experience. Two and a half hours later, I was standing outside The Grand Hotel, central Brno, waiting for Nathan, who arrived soon after.

The last time I was in Brno was on Nathan's wedding day, which I thought was six or seven years prior, but it turned out to be ten; wow - time races by! Nathan now lives in [Chvalkovice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chvalkovice_(Vy%C5%A1kov_District)), a small village in the South Moravian Region of the Czech Republic. It sits around 36 kilometres east of Brno and 218 km southeast of Prague and has about 300 inhabitants. A couple of years ago, I'd seen photos of an overrun back garden and a rundown shell of a house, so I wasn't sure what to expect when I arrived at Nathan's place. What a pleasant surprise! What I found was a beautiful family home with a fabulous manicured garden! And Nathan and his lovely wife had three terrific kids that I had a lot of fun entertaining (and being entertained) during my two-night stay.

I'd brought some pink gin for Nathan (and chocolates for Hannah and English books for the kids), so we began demolishing that via a giant gin and tonic each. More G&T's followed, alongside a couple of glasses of homemade [Slivovitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slivovitz), a fruit brandy made from damson plums, a staple in most Czech homes. That was all drank over a game of chess, which featured my over-committing in the opening, thereby leaving massive holes in my defence that meant I went a rook and knight down. Eek! However, my pushed pawn meant I quickly regained parity, and a more conservative middle game led to me pulling a win out of the fire - huzzah!

I had a sleepless night due to too much alcohol and woke up ever-so-slightly hungover. Fortunately, coffee and toast brought back some semblance of a human, and by the time Nathan and I had enjoyed a bowl of pasta at the lovely vegetarian restaurant [Tilak](https://tilakrestaurace.cz/) in the nearby village of [Střílky](https://www.obecstrilky.cz/), full human mode had come back online. We took home three pizzas from there, and later on, Nathan, his wife, the three kids and I sat around a small fire on the patio and demolished them.

Nathan and I enjoyed catching up - it was great seeing him happy and settled! But the next morning was the day of the game, so it was time to leave my old friend and head up to Prague in the West Ham colours I had put on for the day. He drove me to [Nesovice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nesovice), where I caught a stuffy Soviet-era train into Brno; mind you, the hour journey only cost 65 Kč, around £2!

After arriving in Brno, I stocked up on refreshments in a nearby supermarket before finding my bus for the three-hour journey to Prague, where I arrived around lunchtime. I needed refuelling for the long, nervous evening ahead, so I sat outside the [Cihelna La Familia](https://cihelnalafamilia.cz/) restaurant on Křižíkova in the [Karlín district of Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl%C3%ADn) (just up from the [Florenc bus station](https://www.florenc.cz/index.php?lan=en&site=an&usite=sluzby&sel=usch)) and had a gorgeous salmon risotto and homemade ginger lemonade (I'd decided not to drink before the game, as, unlike the majority of West Ham fans, I wanted to experience the whole event entirely sober; I'd done the same at West Ham's fabulous 3-0 win in the Europa Cup quarter-final in Lyon the previous year and had thoroughly enjoyed myself - it's something I can recommend). Afterwards, I headed to the [Křižíkova metro station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%99i%C5%BE%C3%ADkova_(Prague_Metro)) and made my way up to [Hradčanská](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrad%C4%8Dansk%C3%A1_(Prague_Metro)), where the [West Ham fan park](westHamFanPark.jpg) was situated. There, I found a soulless, muddy, fenced-off space selling sausages and beer - it was full of [fellow West Ham fans](/assets/video/bubblesFanPark.mp4), but it was not really the vibe I was after. The final straw came when [Chesney Hawkes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesney_Hawkes) arrived on stage and proved he wasn't my [one and only ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvMsp7s78Do) by murdering Lennon's _Imagine_. I decided I was better off heading to the old town and finding something more authentically Czech, so I headed back to the metro and the stop [Staroměstská](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starom%C4%9Bstsk%C3%A1_(Prague_Metro)), where I walked up to [Staroměstské náměstí](https://www.prague.eu/en/object/places/183/old-town-square-staromestske-namesti) - the old town square, famous for [Pražský orloj](https://www.prague.eu/cs/objekt/mista/188/staromestska-radnice-s-orlojem) - Prague's astronomical clock.

The square was overrun by West Ham fans! I even bumped into an old friend, Ciaran, whom I hadn't seen since Cardiff's [2006 Fa Cup final between West Ham and Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_FA_Cup_final).

![Ciaran](/assets/images/ciaranPrague.jpg)

We lost that game, thanks to [Lionel Scaloni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni), who, rather than putting the ball into Row Z during the last seconds of the game, smashed it up to Steven Gerrard in the middle of the park, who promptly dispatched it past [Shaka Hislop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaka_Hislop) in the West Ham nets, making it 3-3 and taking the match into extra-time and penalties. Gerrard's was a good goal, but Scaloni should never have given him the ball in the effing first place! Who'd have thought that eejit would end up managing the Argentina World Cup-winning team! I've still not forgiven him for losing his head when we needed calm at the end of that 2006 final - he was supposed to be our most experienced player, too! Grrrr. I hoped my meeting with Ciaran wasn't a bad omen for what would come later that evening.

The West Ham fans in the square were on best behaviour, and the few Fiorentina fans milling around were met with good humour. However, the amount of litter strewn across the square wasn't quite so good, something Katka remarked upon when she arrived a bit later to take me back to where I would stay the next two nights. The only defence I can make for the West Ham fans is that there weren't enough bins, and the few to be found were full. Even so - the beer cans littering the floor weren't a great look.

Katka and I caught a tram back to her flat in [Vršovice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vr%C5%A1ovice) from the top of Václavské náměstí ([Wenceslas Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenceslas_Square)), where numerous important historical events had taken place, including many large demonstrations during the [1989 Velvet Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Revolution) that led to the fall of the Communist Party in the then Czechoslovakia. Meanwhile, I was getting increasingly excited and hoping for some West Ham history a few hours later!

Waiting at the flat were Anna and Toby, two of Katka's three grown-up kids I already knew from their trips to Brighton. Katka prepared an aubergine and chickpea stew before Katka, Anna, and I made the ten-minute walk to the stadium for the final. Anna's boyfriend, Kuba, was stewarding at the game, and he watched on as I entered through the Gate 1 security cordon; his presence nearly turned out to be necessary as I endured a nerve-wracking minute-or-so when something appeared to be wrong with my mobile ticket. That meant some suits and other stewards had a bit of discussion about it all - one of the suits even took a photo of my personal info' from the ticket! Fortunately, after a while, I was allowed through the security cordon, where Kuba greeted me. "What was the problem?" he asked - "I have no idea!" I replied - that's because the discussions were all held in Czech - it's a shame he hadn't come closer to translate! Whatever - even if there was a problem, I bet it would have all been fine, as Kuba, my Guardian angel, might have been able to intervene and smooth things over. I still had one more hurdle to overcome - the turnstile into the stadium itself - thankfully, that went smoothly - a green tick confirmed I could enter. So I waved my thanks to Kuba and headed up some stairs to find my seat.

Oh my! It was still half an hour before kick-off, but the West Ham section was already packed and singing loud and proud!

![West Ham section](/assets/images/westHamSectionPreGame.jpg)

I must have found a ticket for the friends and family section, as behind me were [Saïd Benrahma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%C3%AFd_Benrahma)'s friends, and the row behind them sat [Flynn Downes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_Downes)' family. And I was seated next to [Aaron Cresswell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Cresswell)'s dad, who was quite drunk, much like quite a few around me. Aaron hadn't made the starting line-up, and when I asked his dad how he felt about that, he just shrugged, "It is what it is"; maybe he'd had a few to overcome his disappointment? However, Aaron's dad was a picture of sobriety compared to a group of lads in the row in front of me; they could barely stand up! And they must have added another five or six pints during the game - God only knows what state they were in the following day! Their drunken peaks and troughs were quite funny to witness; they were either effing and blinding at the ref' or falling into a drunken stupor, barely witnessing the game unfolding before them. However, I was less enthralled by their obliviousness to the two young Czech children sitting in front of them, who couldn't have seen the like before! I wanted to say something about that, "Fellas, you have kids in front of you, so it might be good if you toned down the language!" but it wouldn't have achieved anything other than the possibility of a bit of agro, so I decided to let it go - ah well - I suppose if you take your kids to a football match you should expect exposure to some base behaviour. Still, it's a shame it has to be that way.

I got pretty emotional when the teams came out for kick-off - I'd waited a long time to witness my side play in a major European final and found it hard to comprehend that it was actually about to happen! I'd settled down a bit by the time the game started, which it did so at break-neck speed, with first Fiorentina attacking, then West Ham breaking. My heart could not have handled it if the game had continued at that pace, but thankfully it settled down. In fact, if the truth be told, it settled into a pretty scrappy affair. However, the atmosphere in the stands was fantastic, and things livened up even more when one of the Fiorentina players went down in the box as though he'd been shot, claiming he'd been elbowed in the face (which was nonsense). That incensed the West Ham section of the stands, and unfortunately, things turned nasty when [Cristiano Biraghi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Biraghi), the Fiorentina captain, went to take a corner and got struck by a plastic beer cup, which cut his head. I'm not condoning that behaviour (quite the opposite), but the Fiorentina fans were doing the same at the other end, so whoever thought of handing out hard plastic cups inside the stadium needs to rethink their life. And Biraghi didn't help himself when he sarcastically clapped the West Ham fans for throwing stuff - I get it - I didn't like it either! But all that did was incite another barrage leading to the accident - not smart of the Italian player! I was ever-so worried that the game might get abandoned, but I admire Biraghi for getting himself bandaged up and not making much more fuss. So, luckily, the game continued. However, that was not the West Ham fans' finest hour!

Not much more happened in the first half until just before half-time when a Fiorentina header came back off the post, and the rebound was headed in. Thankfully, it was given offside. Phew!

The second half differed from the scrappy first half, with both sides giving it a go. Then, in the sixty-second minute, the West Ham fans' pantomime villain, Cristiano Biraghi, was adjudged (after a lengthy VAR check) to have handled the ball in the box - PENALTY TO WEST HAM! Saïd Benrahma smashed that home ([this video of Benrahma scoring](/assets/video/benrahmaGoalKuba.mp4) was taken by Kuba, who had made his way to the corner flag just below me), and after celebrating wildly, I shook hands with the beaming friends of Benrahma's seated behind me. There was absolute bedlam in the stadium! The five-or-so minutes afterwards were the loudest and most exultant I've ever witnessed inside a football stadium, and I've been to some massive games - FA Cup finals, World Cup quarters and semis and games versus Scotland in the Euros with England, and many famous nights at the [London Stadium](https://www.whufc.com/london-stadium) and [Upton Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boleyn_Ground). I reckon it was finally dawning on us all that West Ham might actually win something!

Unfortunately, that atmosphere was dampened somewhat when Fiorentina's [Giacomo Bonaventura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Bonaventura) equalised in the sixty-seventh minute. And things nearly got much much worse when [Rolando Mandragora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolando_Mandragora) dragged a shot just wide soon after. Only dampened, mind - the stadium was still bouncing, as the game had exploded into life!

Then came the moment that will live long in the memory of the West Ham fans (except, probably, the ever-so-drunken lot in front of me). It was the final minute of normal time when West Ham's Czech international (and ex-Slavia Prague player) [Tomáš Souček](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom%C3%A1%C5%A1_Sou%C4%8Dek) challenged for the ball in midfield, after which it broke nicely for [Lucas Paquetá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Paquet%C3%A1), West Ham's Brazilian Magnifico. He took two touches, the second of which was a brilliant through-ball to a breaking [Jarrod Bowen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Bowen), whose fantastic first touch took the ball away from the defender who was desperately trying to get back and cover, giving Bowen the time to slot his shot across the onrushing Fiorentina keeper and into the back of the net! Oh. My. God! If it was bedlam after Benrahma's penalty, it was absolute-fucking-chaos now! 2 - 1 and only added time left. And despite a few nervy moments, even West Ham didn't manage to mess that up. WE WON! Effin' 'ell!

Since I was in the family and friends section, all the [post-match celebrations were happening in front of me](/assets/images/playerCelebrations.jpg) (the goal celebrations were in my corner, too). So, [after lifting the cup](/assets/images/westHamTrophy.jpeg), the players brought it over to the corner where I was sitting - not that I'd done much sitting! Aaron's dad even got onto the pitch, where I watched him have a kick about with his two very young grandchildren, who were both sporting West Ham kit featuring their dad's number 3. That was a nice moment - unlike the guy in front of me, Aaron's dad had not been drinking during the game, so I reckon he'd sobered up somewhat.

You have to savour the moment when you've had so many trophyless years, so the West Ham fans were going nowhere! The atmosphere was jubilant - like nothing I'd ever witnessed, "European Champions! We know what we are!". That hour or so after the game will live long in my memory.

However, all good things must end, so around a quarter past midnight, nearly an hour and a half after the end of the match, people started to leave, and I went with them. It was awesome that I could simply walk home after an away game in Prague! When I returned to Katka's flat, she, her husband Kuba and Toby were waiting for me with a couple of celebratory beers. After congratulating me, they left me to answer my many "Get in!" WhatsApp messages. Then I watched some of the highlights from the game, including [THAT WINNING GOAL](https://www.bt.com/sport/watch/video/clips/2023/june/scenes-bowen-wins-it-for-west-ham-in-90th-minute). I even found myself on the telly - just after Benrahma's goal, the camera swung round and caught [me texting a friend, "Yesssss!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8kjqwzDMFU&t=4466s) - that's me to the left of the shot in the cream Harrington and West Ham-coloured t-shirt. Was it [fifteen minutes of fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_minutes_of_fame) or fifteen milliseconds? If it was the latter, I've made it - boom! Next, I watched the West Ham press conferences featuring a jubilant Bowen and Moyes. Finally, I relived the whole evening by flicking through some of the photos and videos I'd taken - the West Ham fans singing [_Bowen's on Fire!_](/assets/video/bowensOnFire.mp4) a full hour after the game is probably my all-time-ever-favourite video ever! In other words, it took me a while to wind down - it was gone 3 am when I finally fell asleep.

The next day, I had a bit of work to catch up on, so I hung around the flat and bashed out a few lines of code on my laptop before having lunch and a chat with Katka's youngest daughter, Klara, who made me a sumptuous potato salad. Following a mid-afternoon siesta, Katka came home and dragged me out into the Prague evening via its fantastic tram service, where, for 40 Kč (about £1.40), you get an hour and a half to travel on any of Prague's public transport - bus, tram, train or metro - an absolute bargain. Once in town, we admired [David Cerny's incredible rotating Franz Kafka homage](https://www.tours-prague.eu/prague-franz-kafka-statue.phtml) before having dinner with Anna and Klara at a restaurant opposite the statue - [Dhaba Beas](https://dhababeas.cz/), a yummy vegetarian buffet where you have to weigh your dinner (which made me feel a bit like a horse, and I probably ate enough to satisfy one). Afterwards, we jumped onto Prague's [Petřín funicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet%C5%99%C3%ADn_funicular) and travelled up to the summit of a hill overlooking Prague. Not that we got the view until we'd walked a little down the hill, through a beautiful church courtyard and onto a viewing area near Prague's Swedish embassy. But the view was worth waiting for! Prague is stunning!

![The view over Prague](/assets/images/pragueSwedishEmbassy.jpg)

Klara left us, leaving Katka, Anna and me to return to [Klub Petrohradská](https://www.instagram.com/klubpetrohradska/), a bar opposite Katka's flat, where we met Katka's husband, Kuba. It's a fashionably progressive bar featuring a small cinema and occasional live shows of local bands and DJs; we had a nice half-hour or so there. Kuba reckoned the 220 Kč I paid for two pints and a trendy lemonade was expensive - ha! He should try Brighton - he'd be lucky to get a single pint for that! Beforehand, we met the other Kuba - Anna's boyfriend, who I thanked for looking after me at the stadium. We briefly chatted about the fans' different cultures - the Italians have their Ultras, who all wear black and sit directly behind the goal. They have a drummer and do all the singing for their team. They also don't drink. That's opposed to the English, who drink copious amounts. And everyone sings, sans drummer! There's another difference when the teams are announced; for the Italians, the PA system booms out the first name, after which the fans respond with the second. Whereas, for the English, both first and second names are announced, which gets cheered. Fascinating! Kuba also gave me a match program, a lovely memento of West Ham's most incredible night for many a year, thereby beautifully capping off a lovely evening.

At around 7:45 am the following day, Katka accompanied me to [Vršovice train station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praha-Vr%C5%A1ovice_railway_station), where we caught an 8 am train for the short ride to [Praha hlavní nádraží](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praha_hlavn%C3%AD_n%C3%A1dra%C5%BE%C3%AD), the central train station in Prague.

![coffee in the beautiful art-nouveau main hall at the station](/assets/images/pragueStationMainHall.jpeg)

After a coffee in the beautiful art-nouveau main hall at the station, I caught an 8:45 train back to Vienna. Katka and I had to ask a guard the location of my seat; they told me carriage six and pointed towards the back of the train. However, after we walked past carriage three, then two, then one, we doubted I was going the right way, so we returned to ask the guard for help. He looked at me, exasperated, and said we had been walking in the right direction, "Three, then two, then one, then six!"  I mean, it's fucking obvious that six precedes one, right? Whatever - I eventually found my seat and settled in for the €27, four-and-a-half-hour journey back to the Austrian capital, where I would get my return flight home.

We arrived in Vienna too early to go to the airport, so I jumped off at the central station to find something to eat. Russel, a West Ham fan I'd befriended on the train, came with me. However, when he suggested we use the MacDonalds we found outside the station, I began regretting dragging him along. Thankfully, I persuaded him otherwise; instead, a short walk later, we stumbled upon [Fat Monk](https://www.fatmonk.com/), a new-age deli bowl place that served me a lovely vegetarian something-or-other in a recyclable cardboard dish. Russel enjoyed his spicy chicken fare, too. Boom! I reckon that's enough to pretend I've now visited Vienna.

Two train journeys later, we arrived at Vienna airport, where I left Russel outside, smoking a fag. I went through security and had an over-priced coffee in a lounge overlooking the runway (although, in hindsight, perhaps that was an excellent way of preparing me for the shock of returning to UK prices) before boarding my flight, which took off about an hour late. I sat next to a dad about my age, who had been to the game with his daughter, who was about my eldest daughter Kyra's age (which made me a bit sad because my daughters hadn't witnessed the game with me). We had a lovely time reminiscing about past games, reliving the final, and wondering what would happen to West Ham next.

Once we landed, I breezed through Gatwick security with my biometric passport and boarded the train I had hoped to catch (just for perspective and to prove how much we're getting ripped off in the UK, that was a forty-minute journey that cost me £16); half an hour later, I walked into my home to be greeted by dinner and my lovely missus Kris. At which point, I got to recount the whole trip again, which was alright by me because it was simply fantastic. In fact, as I write this, three days after returning home, I still haven't quite come down - "European Champions! We know what we are!" COYI.
