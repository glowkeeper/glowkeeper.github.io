I remember when,<br />
You first came home.<br />
You'd sleep on my chest;<br />
Total surrender. I fell in love.<br />
<br />
I remember when,<br />
You first went to school.<br />
Your sister, your friend; giggling behind me,<br />
Happy memories. I cherish them all.<br />
<br />
I remember when,<br />
To the pool we'd flee.<br />
Splash for joy, fishy, fishy.<br />
Come into my sea.<br />
<br />
But into the past, I shouldn't stare.<br />
What's important is now.<br />
<br />
Blossoming; a lovely young women,<br />
Let her glow by letting her go.<br />
Her life's hers to fathom,<br />
Watch her confidence grow and grow.<br />
<br />
I remember when,<br />
I found a home for me and you.<br />
"Don't like our room, daddy!"<br />
So I painted it pink, from blue.<br />
<br />
I remember when,<br />
You started to draw.<br />
My favourite bird; a Peregrine Falcon.<br />
Wild, fast and raw.<br />
<br />
I remember when,<br />
You first got on your bike.<br />
You learned to ride it really fast.<br />
But stopping it gave you a fright.<br />
<br />
But into the past, I shouldn't stare.<br />
What's important is now.<br />
<br />
Blossoming; a lovely young women,<br />
Let her glow by letting her go.<br />
Her life's hers to fathom,<br />
Watch her confidence grow and grow.<br />
<br />
I remember when,<br />
You first got on a bus.<br />
Into town; journey without me.<br />
To your freedom, adjust.<br />
<br />
I remember when,<br />
You first learned to ski.<br />
Racing down the black run.<br />
At the chair lift, waiting for me.<br />
<br />
I remember when,<br />
We went to Hyper Japan.<br />
You dressed up as Edward, looking so cool.<br />
A picture snapped by a fan.<br />
<br />
But into the past, I shouldn't stare.<br />
What's important is now.<br />
<br />
Blossoming; a lovely young women,<br />
Let her glow by letting her go.<br />
Her life's hers to fathom,<br />
Watch her confidence grow and grow.<br />
