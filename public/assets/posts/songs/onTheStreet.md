It doesn’t take much, a wrong turn here and there,

A weakness the State judges as a crime.

A flip of a coin that isn’t entirely fair,

A turn of events. It just wasn’t her time.

It doesn’t take much to rely on welfare,

Not the few for the housing.

Give her a chance at getting her share,

Let’s catch the needy in passing.

We can’t all have a hardworking family.

Broken homes aren’t extraordinary.

Broken dreams, unfortunately.

You may not be what you wanted to be.

She sits out in all weathers, life on the street,

With grubby hands and a vacant stare.

Blanket on her lap and a cup by her feet,

She wants to be real. She wants people to care.

We can’t all have a hardworking family.

Broken homes aren’t extraordinary.

Broken dreams, unfortunately.

You may not be what you wanted to be.

She sits out in all weathers, life on the street,

With grubby hands and a vacant stare.

Blanket on her lap and a cup by her feet,

She wants to be real. She wants people to care.

Life is short, much shorter than yours,

Not many live past fifty.

Bus shelters, shop windows, life on the floors,

Because the State has no pity.

It doesn’t take much, so treat people the same,

Don’t judge; it might’ve been you on the street.

Show love, be kind, live a life without blame,

Look past the cup; she’s a person to see.

We can’t all have a hardworking family.

Broken homes aren’t extraordinary.

Broken dreams, unfortunately.

You may not be what you wanted to be.

She sits out in all weathers, life on the street,

With grubby hands and a vacant stare.

Blanket on her lap and a cup by her feet,

She wants to be real. She wants people to care.
