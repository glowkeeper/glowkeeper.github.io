I jumped online to have a good time,
Hoping you'd see the same world as me.
To share a status looking at my greatest.
To post a picture where I'm looking fitter.

I liked a cat wearing a silly hat,
I posted a meme of a current theme.
I shared some news that indisputably proves,
The Chinese exporting aint caused global warming.

We're a Social Media Society,
Hide behind our screens of anxiety.
Hide away from humanity, 
I like you and you like me.

It's an echo chamber. An echo chamber.
An echo chamber. An echo chamber.
An echo chamber. An echo chamber.
It's an echo chamber. An echo chamber.

I shared online ecological crime,
To get you backing against government fracking.
To save the woods and the flatland floods.
I hoped you would want to do some good.

Then I liked a show and a music video,
Shared a story  of a star being worthy.
I took a quiz showing exactly what is,
The place I should live based on answers I give.

We're a Social Media Society,
Hide behind our screens of anxiety.
Hide away from humanity, 
I like you and you like me.

It's an echo chamber. An echo chamber.
An echo chamber. An echo chamber.
An echo chamber. An echo chamber.
It's an echo chamber. An echo chamber.
