_Verse_

What you wearing,
Why you wearing that?
It's such a +++king,
Silly hat,

Aren't you gonna,
Change your shoes?
They really don't,
Look very good on you.

_Bridge_

Don't tell me,
What to +++king do,
I wouldn't ask,
The same of you,

You focus on,
What you wanna wear,
And get out,
Of my +++king hair.

_Chorus_

I'm gonna do,
What I +++king want,
Dance, sing, act,
Like I forgot.

_Verse_

What you reading,
Why you reading that?
That +++king author's,
Such a twat,

Aren't you gonna,
Change your book?
This one here's,
Really +++king good!

_Bridge_

Don't tell me,
What to +++king do,
I wouldn't ask,
The same of you,

You focus on,
What you wanna read,
And get out,
Of my +++king head.

_Chorus_

I'm gonna do,
What I +++king want,
Dance, sing, act,
Like I forgot.
