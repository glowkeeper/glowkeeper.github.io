(Verse)

What you wearing,

Why you wearing that?

It's such a +++king,

Silly hat,

Aren't you gonna,

Change your shoes?

They really don't,

Look very good on you.

(Bridge)

Don't tell me,

What to +++king do,

I wouldn't ask,

The same of you,

You focus on,

What you wanna wear,

And get out,

Of my +++king hair.

(Chorus)

I'm gonna do,

What I +++king want,

Dance, sing, act,

Like I forgot.

(Verse)

What you reading,

Why you reading that?

That +++king author's,

Such a twat,

Aren't you gonna,

Change your book?

This one here's,

Really +++king good!

(Bridge)

Don't tell me,

What to +++king do,

I wouldn't ask,

The same of you,

You focus on,

What you wanna read,

And get out,

Of my +++king head.

(Chorus)

I'm gonna do,

What I +++king want,

Dance, sing, act,

Like I forgot.
