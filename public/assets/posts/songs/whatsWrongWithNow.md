White monied old-men hashtag me too,
Use their dollars to have their fun.
Same sad story; nothing new,
Seduction of power since time begun.

Climate failing, icebergs melting,
Lowlands being washed away.
The people there start migrating,
Put up the barriers, not open today.

But it's hard to see, I must agree,
When you have to peer,  over a veneer,
Of respectability.
When the problem's them, not me.

In an aircon' office from nine to five,
Sit and watch the evening show, 
TV, dinner, and a glass of wine, 
What's wrong with now?

Dirty blanket. Warmed by whisky,
Try and shelter from the wind and rain,
If you don't get housed, dead by fifty,
Another statistic down the drain.

Public service crumbling away,
The safety net's full of anxiety,
The private sell-off of the day,
There's no such thing as society.

But it's hard to see, I must agree,
When you have to peer, over a veneer,
Of respectability.
When the problem's them, not me.

In an aircon' office from nine to five,
Sit and watch the evening show,
TV, dinner, and a glass of wine,
What's wrong with now?
