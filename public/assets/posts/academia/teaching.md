# Teaching

I have extensive experience as a teacher at university level. In 2025, I completed my Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education (PGCertHE) and became a Fellow of Advance HE (FHEA).

## An Introduction to Building 3D Games in Unity

Currently, I am a Visiting Tutor at the [University of Roehampton](https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/), where I have been teaching Foundation Year students how to conduct research and [introducing them to building 3D games in Unity](https://github.com/glowkeeper/IntroToBuilding3DGamesInUnity). The games workshops cover the principles of creating a 3D space through the [Unity](https://unity.com/) games engine, and specifically:

- Modelling
- Materials and Textures
- 3D Physics
- Scripting

## Programming for 3D

From 2020 until 2025, I was Module Convenor for Programming for 3D (P3D) at the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk). There, I took third-year undergraduate and postgraduate students through an intensive course on building a 3D game, using Unity. 

P3D covered:

- Creative Thinking
- Narrative Design
- Agile Project Management
- Source Code Control
- 3D Modelling
- Meshes, Materials, Textures and Shaders
- Lighting
- 3D Physics
- Scripting
- Multimedia
- Animations
- Particle Systems
- Cutscenes

## Fullstack Web Development

From 2020 through to the end of 2021, I was a fullstack web development teacher on a 6-month bootcamp run by [Boolean UK Ltd](https://boolean.co.uk/). The bootcamp covered:

- Mastering HTML and CSS and creating responsive web interfaces
- Utilising Javascript and [React](https://react.dev/)
- Server-side development through [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), SQL and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/.)
