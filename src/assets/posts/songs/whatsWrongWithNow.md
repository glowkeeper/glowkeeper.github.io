title: What's Wrong With Now?
description: My friend Chris and I were at a music festival (Rockaway Beach 2018), when we came up with a phrase that we thought would make a really good title for a song.

White monied old-men hashtag me too,<br />
Use their dollars to have their fun.<br />
Same sad story; nothing new,<br />
Seduction of power since time begun.

Climate failing, icebergs melting,<br />
Lowlands being washed away.<br />
The people there start migrating,<br />
Put up the barriers, not open today.

But it's hard to see, I must agree,<br />
When you have to peer,  over a veneer,<br />
Of respectability.<br />
When the problem's them, not me.

In an aircon' office from nine to five,<br />
Sit and watch the evening show, <br />
TV, dinner, and a glass of wine, <br />
What's wrong with now?

Dirty blanket. Warmed by whisky,<br />
Try and shelter from the wind and rain,<br />
If you don't get housed, dead by fifty,<br />
Another statistic down the drain.

Public service crumbling away,<br />
The safety net's full of anxiety,<br />
The private sell-off of the day,<br />
There's no such thing as society.

But it's hard to see, I must agree,<br />
When you have to peer, over a veneer,<br />
Of respectability.<br />
When the problem's them, not me.

In an aircon' office from nine to five,<br />
Sit and watch the evening show, <br />
TV, dinner, and a glass of wine, <br />
What's wrong with now?
