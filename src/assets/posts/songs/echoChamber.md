I jumped online to have a good time,<br />
Hoping you'd see the same world as me.<br />
To share a status looking at my greatest.<br />
To post a picture where I'm looking fitter.

I liked a cat wearing a silly hat,<br />
I posted a meme of a current theme.<br />
I shared some news that indisputably proves,<br />
The Chinese exporting aint caused global warming.

We're a Social Media Society,<br />
Hide behind our screens of anxiety.<br />
Hide away from humanity, <br />
I like you and you like me.

It's an echo chamber. An echo chamber.<br />
An echo chamber. An echo chamber.<br />
An echo chamber. An echo chamber.<br />
It's an echo chamber. An echo chamber.

I shared online ecological crime,<br />
To get you backing against government fracking.<br />
To save the woods and the flatland floods.<br />
I hoped you would want to do some good.

Then I liked a show and a music video,<br />
Shared a story  of a star being worthy.<br />
I took a quiz showing exactly what is,<br />
The place I should live based on answers I give.

We're a Social Media Society,<br />
Hide behind our screens of anxiety.<br />
Hide away from humanity, <br />
I like you and you like me.

It's an echo chamber. An echo chamber.<br />
An echo chamber. An echo chamber.<br />
An echo chamber. An echo chamber.<br />
It's an echo chamber. An echo chamber.
