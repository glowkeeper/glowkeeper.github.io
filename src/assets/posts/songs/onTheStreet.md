It doesn't take much, a wrong turn here and there,<br />
A weakness the State judges as a crime.<br />
A flip of a coin that isn't entirely fair,<br />
A turn of events. It just wasn't her time.

It doesn't take much to rely on welfare,<br />
Not the few for the housing.<br />
Give her a chance at getting her share,<br />
Let's catch the needy in passing.

We can't all have a hardworking family.<br />
Broken homes aren't extraordinary.<br />
Broken dreams, unfortunately.<br />
You may not be what you wanted to be.

She sits out in all weathers, life on the street,<br />
With grubby hands and a vacant stare.<br />
Blanket on her lap and a cup by her feet,<br />
She wants to be real. She wants people to care.

We can't all have a hardworking family.<br />
Broken homes aren't extraordinary.<br />
Broken dreams, unfortunately.<br />
You may not be what you wanted to be.

She sits out in all weathers, life on the street,<br />
With grubby hands and a vacant stare.<br />
Blanket on her lap and a cup by her feet,<br />
She wants to be real. She wants people to care.

Life is short, much shorter than yours,<br />
Not many live past fifty.<br />
Bus shelters, shop windows, life on the floors,<br />
Because the State has no pity.

It doesn't take much, so treat people the same,<br />
Don't judge; it might've been you on the street.<br />
Show love, be kind, live a life without blame,<br />
Look past the cup; she's a person to see.

We can't all have a hardworking family.<br />
Broken homes aren't extraordinary.<br />
Broken dreams, unfortunately.<br />
You may not be what you wanted to be.

She sits out in all weathers, life on the street,<br />
With grubby hands and a vacant stare.<br />
Blanket on her lap and a cup by her feet,<br />
She wants to be real. She wants people to care.
