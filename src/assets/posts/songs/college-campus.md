<p>I met a girl from the college campus,<br />
I liked her, she was a sight to see.<br />
But it took a while, my task was thankless,<br />
‘cause she wouldn’t come out with me.<br />
<br />
Because…<br />
<br />
She had deadlines.<br />
She had deadlines.<br />
Yeah! She had deadlines.<br />
She had deadlines, so she wasn’t free!<br />
<br />
Sounds like an excuse to me….<br />
<br />
(Solo)<br />
<br />
We went for a coffee on the college campus,<br />
We talked about philosophy.<br />
But on my mind was not Karl Marx,<br />
‘cause she wouldn’t come out with me.<br />
<br />
Because…<br />
<br />
She had deadlines.<br />
She had deadlines.<br />
Yeah! She had deadlines.<br />
She had deadlines,<br />
So she wasn’t free!<br />
<br />
(Solo)<br />
<br />
We went for a drink off the college campus,<br />
We had a laugh in the Brighton back streets.<br />
We kissed, at last, on the last bus,<br />
And all because she came out with me.<br />
<br />
Because…<br />
<br />
She didn’t have deadlines.<br />
She didn’t have deadlines.<br />
Yeah! She didn’t have deadlines. <br />
She didn’t have deadlines,<br />
So she was free!<br /></p>
