My virtual keyboard's a clock sucking prude,<br/>
When I'm angry, and want to shout "Ships!"<br/>
It substitutes words more tucking refined,<br/>
The mother ducker really gets on my tips!

Get this! My girlfriend, last night, got off her pollocks,<br/>
She's lying, next to me, nearly dead.<br/>
And I'm wondering, frustrated, ever-so-flummoxed,<br/>
Fingers-crossed she'll recover, and give me...bread.

Then; a friend let me down on some tickets.<br/>
For a band I'd been thinking were pukka.<br/>
So I launched a tirade; "that's bull sit you grunt!"<br/>
"You're a mother ducking plucking clock trucker!"

Yes; my text speak nanny is a muddy ducker,<br/>
Why shouldn't I scream: "I'm pluck doff!"<br/>
It gives me the urge to launch the phone in the gutter!<br/>
'cause the bulls hit prothesis me off!

But worse; eventually, it starts to predict,<br/>
How you meant to respond to your mother.<br/>
So when you intended: "Of course, perfect!"<br/>
Rather, you send: "Get lost, fucker!"

Oops! So I have some very prudent advice.<br/>
Disable keyboard nanny when you're home.<br/>
Don't bank on your shitty motherfucking device.<br/>
Instead, learn to spell on your own.
