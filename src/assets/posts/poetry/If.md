A modern take on what appear to be the virtues needed for the highest office. It is based on [If](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46473/if---), by Rudyard Kipling.

I've written a [song](/posts/songs/If), based on this poem.

:-------|:-----------
If you can rant and rave when all about you | If you can keep your head when all about you
Are staying calm regardless, and despising you, | Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself despite huge doubts about you, | If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
And ignore all those that doubt you too; | But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can't wait and childishly fear waiting, | If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or lie non-stop, deal exclusively in lies, | Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or hate, foster an atmosphere of hating, | Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
And distort, nor seek counsel from the wise: | And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
If you quash dreams-make dream-quashing your master; | If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
If you don't think-make thoughtless speech your game; | If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can Triumph while others meet Disaster | If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And don't treat those two extremes the same; | And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear the chaos from lies you've spoken | If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
Ignore truth imparted by counsel skilful, | Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch our beautiful world, now broken, | Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And not mend her by taxing the powerful: | And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
If you can make the 1% more winnings | If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk not a jot reviving those who've lost, | And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And mistreat those you've failed from the beginning | And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And breathe fiery words at their loss; | And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can act with heartless greed anew | If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To self-serve and crush hope for everyone, | To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And cling on when there's nothing good within you | And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except Ignorant Will which says to you: 'Hold on!' | Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
If you can rant at crowds and dispel all virtue, | If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings, never the common touch, | Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If you scream "fake news!" when they dare to slight you, | If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If just few men validate your poisoned touch; | If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute | If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With one-hundred-and-forty keys shotgun, | With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth plundered for everything in it, | Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
And, what's more, you'll lead the 'free world', my son! | And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
